# Benchmarks

Run on 2026-11-05 on an Apple M4 laptop with Node.js 25.9, against shallow clones of four public repositories. Times are wall-clock for a single run, and they varied by up to about 1.5x between runs on the same machine.

| Repo | Commit | Source files | Graph nodes / edges |
|---|---|---|---|
| [excalidraw/excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) | `0c9b449` | 710 | 5,349 / 29,872 |
| [shadcn-ui/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) | `8a35366` | 4,426 | 17,730 / 83,189 |
| [TryGhost/Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) | `d7f3a0a` | 7,280 | 34,310 / 144,138 |
| [calcom/cal.com](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com) | `2eb48ec` | 5,025 | 20,078 / 89,460 |

## Speed and memory

| Repo | `scan` | `check` HEAD~1 | `check` HEAD~30 | Peak memory |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| excalidraw | 3.1 s | 6.4 s | 5.5 s (208 files changed) | 501 MB |
| shadcn/ui | 6.4 s | 15.2 s | 12.9 s (52 files changed) | 492 MB |
| Ghost | 10.0 s | 29.7 s | 21.1 s (251 files changed) | 794 MB |
| cal.com | 4.8 s | 16.9 s | 18.8 s (131 files changed) | 689 MB |

`check` analyzes the project twice, base and head, and writes the base to a temp directory, so it costs roughly two scans plus the extraction. The time depends on repository size, not on how many files the change touches. A GitHub-hosted runner (4 vCPU, 16 GB) has enough headroom for all four.

## False alarms on real history

`check` was run on the last 1 and the last 30 merged commits of each repository. Those are human-reviewed changes, so blocking findings there are most likely false alarms.

| Repo | HEAD~1 | HEAD~30 |
|---|---|---|
| excalidraw | pass | pass (1 newly-test-only warning, 3 uncertain) |
| shadcn/ui | pass | pass |
| Ghost | pass (2 test-only-addition, 1 unused-dependency warnings) | pass (3 test-only-addition, 1 unused-dependency warnings) |
| cal.com | pass | pass |

Before the fixes listed below, the HEAD~30 runs on excalidraw and Ghost had 3 blocking false alarms: a load-time `register({...})` call, a `declare global` block, and a `.d.mts` file. After the fixes there are 0 blocking findings across all 8 runs.

## Catching an agent-style change

An agent-style change was applied to cal.com:

1. Copy `packages/lib/convertToNewDurationType.ts` to `convertDurationV2.ts`.
2. Switch its only caller to the copy.
3. Add an unused `formatMinutes.ts` helper.

`check` reported:

- `superseded` on the old file, citing the moved caller and 100% structural similarity,
- `orphaned-addition` on the unused helper,
- `newly-orphaned` on a constant only the old function used.

The check failed as it should.

## Whole-project scan: how many orphans are real?

`scan` reports existing unreachable files. To estimate false positives without knowing each codebase, every orphaned file's name was searched for inside import-like strings in files that Loose Ends considers live, and in non-source files. A hit means the orphan might be loaded by something the graph misses. It is an upper bound on false positives: many hits are just different files with the same name.

| Repo | Orphaned files | Mentioned by live or config files | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| excalidraw | 11 | 3 (27%) | The remaining hits are docs examples and a vendored file. |
| shadcn/ui | 123 | 68 (55%) | 60 of the 123 orphans are `templates/`, project scaffolding the CLI copies into new apps. Excluding `templates/**` is the right config for this repo. |
| Ghost | 435 | 32 (7%) | Mostly storage and scheduling adapters loaded by name from JSON config. That is a known limit: declare them in `entries`. |
| cal.com | 467 | 131 (28%) | Hand-checked samples were mostly real dead code with a same-named live twin (two `OnboardingCard.tsx` and two `TwoFactorAuthAPI.ts` files, for example). |

## Bugs found and fixed by this benchmark

| Problem | Seen in | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `@/` aliases defined in a referenced tsconfig (`tsconfig.json` → `tsconfig.app.json`) were not followed | Ghost (orphans dropped from 848 to 437) | Follow tsconfig `references` |
| `@/` and `~/` Vite-style aliases without tsconfig paths | Ghost | Resolve to the package `src/` |
| `#internal` subpath imports were stripped as URL fragments | (found while fixing the above) | Keep a leading `#`, read package.json `imports` |
| Workspace packages imported through tsconfig paths counted as unused dependencies | excalidraw | Aliases carry their package name |
| Files named in tool config strings (`setupFiles`, plugin paths, `registry.json`) | excalidraw, shadcn/ui, Ghost | Become test or tooling roots |
| Docusaurus sites | excalidraw `dev-docs/` | New framework provider |
| `export const x = register({...})` counted as unused | excalidraw | Load-time calls keep a declaration live |
| `declare global {}` and `.d.mts` reported | Ghost | Ignored |
| Packages used only in config (`"extends": "@acme/tsconfig"`) | cal.com | Counted as used |

## A Python-heavy repo with a browser extension

A private repo with 315 Python files, 7 JavaScript files (a Chrome extension and two tests), and about 850 MB of generated JSON, PDF, and LaTeX output.

- `scan` first reported all 4 extension scripts as orphaned, because they are loaded by `manifest.json` and `<script>` tags in HTML pages. A web extension provider now reads both. The one remaining orphan is a minified bundle saved as research data, which nothing loads.
- `check` took 43–62 s, almost all of it extracting the base revision: `git archive` wrote every tracked file, including thousands of PDFs. The snapshot now skips binaries, documents, and files far from JS/TS code. On this repo the snapshot dropped from 6.7 s to 1.0 s and cleanup from 5 s to 25 ms. On shadcn/ui, `check` HEAD~30 went from 17.8 s to 16.1 s and peak memory from 605 MB to 452 MB, with identical findings on all four public repos. The old snapshot also held the whole archive in memory with a 1 GB cap, so repos above that size would have failed.

The Python files in this repo are now analyzed too; see below.

## Python

Run on 2026-11-06 against shallow clones of six public Python repositories. `scan` takes 60–360 ms on each.

| Repo | Commit | Python files | Python findings from `scan` | Checked by hand |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template](https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template) | `aabb901` | 43 | 1 test-only | `crud.create_item` is only called from tests. |
| [django/djangoproject.com](https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com) | `9f69c93` | 266 | 3 orphaned, 4 unused dependencies | `SIMPLE_SEARCH_OPERATORS`, `fundraising/exceptions.py`, and `StripeTextInput` have no users. `babel`, `python-dateutil`, and `pydata-sphinx-theme` are not imported anywhere; `pillow` is only imported by test code. |
| [miguelgrinberg/microblog](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microblog) | `a975ef6` | 34 | none | |
| [pallets/flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) | `49943b5` | 83 | 3 orphaned | `_make_timedelta` in `app.py` (a leftover copy of the one in `sansio/app.py`) and `_path_is_ancestor` in `cli.py` have no callers. `examples/celery/make_celery.py` is started by a command in the example's README, which is not read. |
| [encode/httpx](https://github.com/encode/httpx) | `b5addb6` | 60 | 1 orphaned | `URLTypes` in the private `_types.py`, kept on purpose for users who import it from there. |
| [karpathy/nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) | `3adf61e` | 15 | 2 orphaned | `decode` in a data prep script and `unoptimized_model` in `train.py` are never used. |

`check` was run on every commit that touched Python in the cloned history: 249 commits across the six repositories, all passing with no blocking findings. The non-blocking warnings were: dependencies added without an import (the four above, when they were added), a Sphinx extension that moved to being loaded through `PYTHONPATH`, and one near-identical Flask form class.

Two private repositories were also checked: a Django app with scrapers and a browser extension (about 300 Python files, `scan` in 0.9 s), and a small evaluation package. `scan` reported 34 orphaned items; 15 were checked by hand and none has a caller. Replaying 46 commits failed 4, each for code that is still unused today: two unused loggers, an unused constant, and a function that a new one replaced.

### Bugs found and fixed while testing on Python repos

| Problem | Seen in | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Scripts run as `python train.py` with no `__main__` guard were reported dead | nanoGPT | Files that run top-level calls, loops, or `with` blocks and that no module imports are scripts |
| `exec(open("configurator.py").read())` and `config/*.py` passed on the command line | nanoGPT | Strings naming a `.py` file link to it; files in `config/` that only assign settings are roots |
| `pip freeze` output listed transitive packages as unused | microblog | Fully pinned requirement files are not checked |
| `FLASK_APP=microblog.py` in `.flaskenv` | microblog | `.flaskenv` is read like other command files |
| URL confs and host confs named only by string (`ROOT_HOSTCONF = "djangoproject.hosts"`) | djangoproject.com | A module named by string is read by attribute, so its public names count |
| `@stat("Commits")` registers the function in a list | djangoproject.com | A decorator called with arguments registers the function |
| Classic `<script>` files in `static/` define globals for each other | djangoproject.com | Every top-level declaration in such a script is a root |
| Distribution names that differ from import names (`django-money` → `djmoney`, `sorl-thumbnail` → `sorl`) | djangoproject.com | A larger mapping table |
| Module-level `__getattr__` (PEP 562) | flask | Dunder functions are called by Python |
| `from ._api import *` in a library's `__init__.py` | httpx | Star imports re-export the target's `__all__` |
| React Email templates in `emails/` (JavaScript) | full-stack-fastapi-template | New framework provider |
| Lists of strings reported as duplicates of other lists | private repo | Declarations that are mostly literals are not compared |

## Java

Run on 2026-11-06 against clones of six public Java repositories. `scan` takes 0.1–1.5 s on each, including 2,042 files in 1.5 s.

| Repo | Commit | Java files | Findings from `scan` | Checked by hand |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [spring-projects/spring-petclinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) | `500158f` | 50 | none | |
| [gothinkster/spring-boot-realworld-example-app](https://github.com/gothinkster/spring-boot-realworld-example-app) | `ee17e31` | 116 | none | |
| [square/javapoet](https://github.com/square/javapoet) | `b9017a9` | 39 | none | A library: its public types are API. |
| [quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts) | `81a5844` | 649 | 1 orphaned | `QuoteDeserializer` in the Kafka producer is never used. |
| [TeamNewPipe/NewPipe](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe) | `f42fe70` | 293 (and 293 Kotlin) | none | |
| [iluwatar/java-design-patterns](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns) | `4cabb20` | 2,042 | 1 orphaned, 13 test-only, 1 unused dependency | `ProductCatalogService` has no users, the 13 test-only types are only used by tests, and `swing-layout` is never imported. (An earlier version also reported `system-lambda`; the parent pom's `dependencyManagement` makes it test scope, which is now read.) |

`check` was run on every commit that touched Java, build files, or resources in the cloned history: 445 commits. One failed, and it was right: a NewPipe commit replaced `FocusAwareSeekBar` in the player layout, which left the class unused until a later commit subclassed it. The warnings were near-identical classes (small DTOs, and code copied from one quickstart into another) and two classes a new pattern added that only its tests used.

The agent-style change from the cal.com test, applied to spring-petclinic (copy `PetValidator` to `PetValidatorV2`, switch `PetController` to it, add an unused `NameFormatter`), failed with `superseded` on `PetValidator`, citing the moved caller and 100% structural similarity, and `orphaned-addition` on `NameFormatter`.

### Bugs found and fixed while testing on Java repos

| Problem | Seen in | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Modules that repeat the same fully qualified class names resolved to the first one found | quarkus-quickstarts | Keep every candidate and pick the one closest to the referencing file |
| Netflix DGS (`@DgsComponent`) and similar framework annotations | spring-boot-realworld-example-app | Annotations named like `…Component`, `…Controller`, `…Service`, `…Repository` are framework roots |
| MyBatis type handlers registered by package (`mybatis.type-handlers-package=…`) | spring-boot-realworld-example-app | A package in a `…package` or `…scan` setting roots its types |
| Classes whose framework entry is a method (`@Funq`, `@Route`, `@Incoming`, `@Observes`) | quarkus-quickstarts | Member annotations make the type a root |
| Custom views and fragments named in Android `res/` XML | NewPipe | `res/**/*.xml` is read for class names |
| Java classes used only from Kotlin | NewPipe | Kotlin imports, same-package names, and fully qualified names count |
| JS scripts run by GitHub workflows (`require('./.github/workflows/x.js')`) | NewPipe, shadcn/ui, Ghost | New provider; files in `paths:` filters are not roots |
| `javax.xml.bind` treated as part of the JDK | java-design-patterns | It left the JDK in Java 11 |

## Sweep of 30 popular repositories

`scan` was run on shallow clones of 10 well-known repositories per language, none of them used to build the tool: axios, express, zustand, TanStack Query, zod, React Router, Prettier, Fastify, NestJS, tRPC; requests, click, Starlette, HTTPie, Black, Scrapy, Poetry, Pydantic, Jinja, Rich; Gson, jsoup, Commons Lang, MyBatis, Guava, RxJava, ZXing, Netty, Jenkins, Commons IO. None crashed, and the largest (Netty, 2,500 Java files) took 2.3 s.

Python came back nearly clean on the first run (0 to 11 orphaned files per repo). JS/TS and Java exposed gaps, grouped by cause rather than one by one:

| Gap | Effect before | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Vue, Svelte, and Astro components were not parsed | everything imported only from a component looked unused | `<script>` blocks and Astro frontmatter are parsed; names used in the template count |
| No SvelteKit, Astro, Nuxt, NestJS, React Router framework mode, or VitePress conventions | route files, pages, and app entries were orphaned | entry points for each, plus SvelteKit's `$lib` alias and components imported from VitePress Markdown |
| Java library rule only looked under `src/main/java` and skipped any module with a `main` | Guava's public API (670 files), RxJava, Netty reported | every non-test file of a library module counts; a module with a `main` is still a library when the build is published (`<scm>`, `distributionManagement`, `maven-publish`) |
| `@Extension` (Jenkins) and `@Benchmark` (JMH, Caliper) | extensions and benchmarks orphaned | treated as entry points |
| Maven scope inherited from a parent's `dependencyManagement` was ignored | test libraries reported as unused compile dependencies (Netty: 64) | managed scope is read |
| Samples, templates, and test packages reported every dependency | hundreds of unused-dependency findings for code already reported as orphaned or test-only | packages with no production-live file are skipped |
| maturin `python-source` and setuptools `where` layouts | pydantic-core's public API (201 symbols) reported | read from `pyproject.toml` |

| Repository | Orphaned files before → after | Unused dependencies before → after |
|---|---:|---:|
| TanStack Query | 344 → 139 | 170 → 39 |
| React Router | 247 → 143 | 101 → 49 |
| NestJS | 274 → 274 | 18 → 3 |
| Guava | 670 → 58 | 2 → 0 |
| RxJava | 66 → 1 | 0 → 0 |
| Netty | 142 → 20 | 64 → 9 |
| Jenkins | 229 → 160 | 21 → 21 |

What remains is mostly code nothing in the repository runs: example and sample folders outside the workspace (NestJS `sample/`, Express `examples/`), benchmark and tree-shaking scripts run by hand (zod), Vue 2 examples excluded from the TanStack workspace, and Jenkins core classes kept as API for external plugins, which the tool cannot see. Spot checks of the rest found real dead code, such as an unused `Java8Compatibility` copy in Guava's `base` package.
