# Configuration

Loose Ends reads the first of these that exists in the project root:

1. `loose-ends.config.json`
2. `.loose-endsrc.json`
3. the `looseEnds` key in `package.json`

Every option is optional. Run `npx loose-ends init` to write a starter file, and add `"$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sid732/loose-ends/main/schema/config.schema.json"` for editor completion. Unknown keys are an error, so typos fail loudly instead of being ignored.

```json
{
  "entries": ["src/jobs/*.ts", "src/events/handlers.ts#onInvoicePaid"],
  "extendExclude": ["src/generated/**"],
  "dormant": [{ "target": "src/billing/v1/**", "reason": "v1 webhooks still arrive until March" }],
  "suppressions": [
    { "target": "src/flags.ts#betaSearch", "kind": "orphaned-addition", "reason": "wired up in #412", "expires": "2026-12-31" }
  ],
  "checks": ["npm run typecheck", "npm test"],
  "coverage": "coverage/coverage-final.json"
}
```

## Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `include` / `extendInclude` | `**/*.{ts,tsx,mts,cts,js,jsx,mjs,cjs,vue,svelte,astro}`, `**/*.py`, `**/*.ipynb`, `**/*.java` | Source files to analyze. `include` replaces the default and `extendInclude` adds to it. |
| `exclude` / `extendExclude` | `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `out`, `coverage`, `.next`, `*.d.ts`, `__pycache__`, `.venv`, `venv`, `.tox`, `site-packages`, `target`, `.gradle`, … | Files to ignore. The root `.gitignore` is applied as well. |
| `testPatterns` / `extendTestPatterns` | `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `__tests__/`, `test/`, `tests/`, `e2e/`, `*.stories.*`, `fixtures/`, `test_*.py`, `*_test.py`, `tests.py`, `conftest.py`, `src/test/`, `src/androidTest/`, `*Test.java`, `*Tests.java`, `*IT.java` | Files that count as tests. Tests are roots, but code reachable only from tests is reported as test-only. |
| `languages` | `["javascript", "python", "java"]` | Languages to analyze. Remove one to skip its files entirely. |
| `entries` | `[]` | Extra production roots. Use these for things a runtime loads by name, such as job files or plugin modules. `path#symbol` makes just one export a root. |
| `frameworks` | `"auto"` | Which framework conventions to apply. `auto` reads each workspace package's dependencies and each Python project's requirements. JS names include `next`, `vite`, `sveltekit`, `astro`, `nuxt`, `nest`, `react-router`, `vitepress`; Python names: `django`, `flask`, `fastapi`, `celery`, `alembic`, `airflow`, `streamlit`, `pytest`. |
| `dormant` | `[]` | Code that is unreachable on purpose. Every rule needs a `reason`. |
| `suppressions` | `[]` | Findings that have been reviewed and accepted. Every suppression needs a `reason`. `kind` limits it to one finding kind, and once `expires` passes the suppression stops working and is reported. |
| `checks` | `[]` | Commands run by `loose-ends fix --verify` and `--apply` against the cleaned-up copy. |
| `failOn` | `orphaned-addition`, `newly-orphaned`, `superseded`, `invalid-suppression` | Finding kinds that make `check` exit 1 and fail the check run. |
| `tsconfig` | nearest `tsconfig.json` / `jsconfig.json` | Path aliases (`paths`, `baseUrl`) used for resolution. |
| `coverage` | none | Runtime coverage report, used as supporting evidence. |
| `dependencies` | `true` | Analyze `dependencies` in each package.json, production requirements of each Python project, and compile-scope Maven and Gradle dependencies. |
| `ignoreDependencies` | `[]` | Globs of dependencies that are loaded implicitly (npm names, Python distribution names, or Maven `group:artifact`). |

## Inline directives

Directives go in comments (`//` in JavaScript and Java, `#` in Python). A `loose-ends:` comment applies to the declaration directly below it, and a `loose-ends-file:` comment applies to the whole file. In Python, a `loose-ends:` comment at the end of a line applies to the statement on that line.

```ts
// loose-ends-file: entry

// loose-ends: dormant re-enabled when billing v2 ships
export function exportLegacyInvoices() {}

// loose-ends: ignore orphaned-addition wired up in the next PR
export function draftHandler() {}

// loose-ends: entry
export const onMessage = () => {};
```

| Directive | Effect |
|---|---|
| `entry` | Makes the declaration (or file) a production root. |
| `dormant <reason>` | Marks unreachable code as intentionally unused. Anything reachable only through it becomes dormant too. |
| `ignore [kind] <reason>` | Suppresses findings on the declaration (or file), optionally for a single kind. |

```python
# loose-ends-file: entry

# loose-ends: dormant re-enabled when billing v2 ships
def export_legacy_invoices(): ...

def draft_handler(): ...  # loose-ends: ignore orphaned-addition wired up in the next PR
```

A `dormant` or `ignore` directive without a reason is reported as `invalid-suppression`, which blocks by default. Reasons are kept so that whoever revisits the code knows why it stayed.

## Roots Loose Ends finds on its own

- `main`, `module`, `browser`, `bin`, and `exports` in every workspace `package.json`. Without a workspace config, `package.json` files up to three levels down (an `app/` and a `server/` side by side) count as packages too. Library entry points make all of their exports public API.
- Files run by package scripts (`node x.js`, `tsx src/server.ts`, …). Scripts named like `test*` count as test roots, and `build`, `lint`, `db`, `seed`, and similar names count as tooling roots.
- A conventional entry (`index`, `src/index`, `src/main`, `server`, `app`) for packages that declare none.
- Next.js: App Router special files (`page`, `layout`, `route`, `loading`, `error`, `not-found`, metadata files, …), every file under `pages/`, `middleware`, `instrumentation`, and `next.config`. Only exports Next.js reads count as roots, so an extra helper exported from a page is still reported.
- Vite: `<script src>` tags in `index.html`.
- Browser extensions: scripts named in a `manifest.json` that has `manifest_version` (background, content scripts, web-accessible resources), and `<script src>` tags in the HTML pages it names (popup, options, side panel, devtools). No `package.json` is needed.
- Docusaurus config, sidebars, pages, and swizzled theme components.
- Scripts in each package's `public/` directory, which Vite, Next.js, and Create React App serve by URL.
- Storybook config, Vercel `api/` functions, Netlify functions, and tool config files (`*.config.*`, `.*rc.*`).
- Test files.

For Python:

- Files with `if __name__ == "__main__":`, `__main__.py` files, and files that run top-level code (calls, loops, `with` blocks) that no module imports.
- Entry points in `pyproject.toml` (`[project.scripts]`, `gui-scripts`, `entry-points`, Poetry `scripts` and `plugins`), `setup.py`, and `setup.cfg`.
- Packages that are built and published (a `[build-system]`, `setup.py`, or `setup.cfg`, and no Dockerfile, Procfile, `manage.py`, or similar app signal): every module whose path has no `_private` part is public API, along with its public names (or the names in `__all__`).
- Commands in Dockerfiles, Compose files, Procfiles, `.flaskenv`, Makefiles, shell scripts, GitHub workflows, `tox.ini`, `pyproject.toml`, serverless templates, and similar files: `python path/to/x.py`, `python -m pkg.mod`, `uvicorn`/`gunicorn`/`hypercorn` targets like `app.main:app`, `celery -A proj`, `flask --app`, `FLASK_APP`, and Lambda `handler:` paths.
- A conventional entry (`main.py`, `app.py`, `wsgi.py`, `asgi.py`, `manage.py`, `server.py`, `run.py`, …) in each Python project, its `src/`, and its `app/`.
- Strings that name a local module: `INSTALLED_APPS`, `ROOT_URLCONF`, middleware paths, `"app.main:app"`, `importlib.import_module("x.y")`, and `exec(open("config.py").read())`. A module named this way is read by attribute, so its public names count as used.
- Django (when it is a dependency): settings, `wsgi`/`asgi`, migrations, management commands, template tags, and `models`, `admin`, `apps`, `signals`, and `tasks` modules in app folders. Celery: `tasks.py`. Alembic: `env.py` and `versions/`. Airflow: `dags/` and `plugins/`. Streamlit: `pages/`.
- Decorators that register a function (`@app.get(...)`, `@router.post(...)`, `@receiver(...)`, `@shared_task`, any decorator called with arguments), and classes that register themselves (ORM models, `TestCase` subclasses, classes with a metaclass), keep the function or class alive whenever its module is loaded.
- Notebooks (`.ipynb`), `setup.py`, `noxfile.py`, `fabfile.py`, `docs/conf.py`, files in `config/` folders that only assign settings, and scripts in `static/` folders.

Python requirement files named for development, tests, docs, or CI (`requirements-dev.txt`, `requirements/test.txt`, …) are not checked. Neither is a fully pinned file of ten or more packages, because `pip freeze` output lists transitive packages that no code imports directly; keep direct dependencies in `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.in` to have them checked. Packages that are normally used without an import (database drivers, servers like `gunicorn`, linters, type stubs, common transitive packages) are ignored.

For Java:

- Types with a `main` method, `module-info.java`, and `package-info.java`.
- Types the framework creates: Spring stereotypes (`@Component`, `@Service`, `@RestController`, `@Configuration`, …) and other `…Component`/`…Controller`/`…Service`-style annotations, JPA entities, JAX-RS resources, CDI beans, servlets, Quarkus, Micronaut, MyBatis and MapStruct mappers, Dagger/Hilt, Room, and `@AutoService`.
- Types with members the framework calls: `@Scheduled`, `@EventListener`, `@KafkaListener`, `@Incoming`, `@Observes`, `@Bean`, `@Funq`, `@Route`, GraphQL resolvers, and JAX-RS methods.
- Subclasses of types frameworks instantiate: Spring Data repositories, Panache, servlets and filters, Android activities, services, and receivers, and `CommandLineRunner`.
- Class names in resource and build files: `META-INF/services`, `spring.factories`, Spring XML, `web.xml`, `*.properties`, Android manifests (including `.RelativeName`) and `res/` layouts, and `pom.xml`/`build.gradle` plugin settings. A package named in a `…package` or `…scan` setting makes every type in it a root.
- `Class.forName("…")` strings in Java code.
- Java types that Kotlin code imports, sees in its own package, or names in full. Kotlin is not analyzed otherwise.
- A Maven or Gradle module with no application plugin (Spring Boot, `application`, Android app, Quarkus, Micronaut, war packaging) and no `main` method is a library: its public types are API.
- Scripts in `src/main/resources/{static,public,META-INF/resources}` and `src/main/webapp`.

Java symbols are top-level types. Methods and fields are not tracked one by one. A type that another file imports counts as used even if nothing calls it, because deleting it would break compilation. Dependencies are matched to imported packages by Maven group (with a table for groups whose packages differ, like Guava). Starters, BOMs, JDBC drivers, logging back ends, and Quarkus and Micronaut extensions are ignored. Modules that contain Kotlin sources are not checked.
